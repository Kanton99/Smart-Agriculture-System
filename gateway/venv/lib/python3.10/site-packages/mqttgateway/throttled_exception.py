''' An exception class that throttles events in case an error is triggered too often.

_THROTTLELAG = 10 # in seconds

class ThrottledException(Exception):
    ''' Exception class base to throttle events

    This exception can be used as a base class instead of :class:`Exception`.
    It adds a counter and a timer that allow to silence the error for a while if
    desired.  Only after a given period a trigger is set to ``True`` to indicate
    that a number of errors have happened and it is time to report them.

    It defines 2 members:

    - ``trigger`` is a boolean set to True after the requested lag;
    - ``report`` is a string giving some more information on top of the latest message.

    The code using these exceptions can test the member ``trigger`` and decide to silence
    the error until it is True.  At any point one can still decide to use these exceptions
    as normal ones, ignore the ``trigger`` and ``report`` members and just raise the
    exception as *normal*.

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        try:
            #some statements that might raise your own exception derived from ThrottledException
        except YourExceptionError as err:
            if err.trigger:
                log(err.report)

    Args:
        msg (string): the error message, as for usual exceptions, optional
        throttlelag (int): the lag time in seconds while errors should be throttled, defaults
          to 10 seconds
        module_name (string): the calling module to give extra information, optional
