# Concept
The Smart Home-Agriculture System is a device that will read the moisture level of your plants and irrigate them accordingly to keep them at their optimal moisture levels. This will make the tending of the plants easier on the owner, providing also data through an app. 

# Persona
Someone traveled and needed to monitor the plants. How is it possible to do that using our solution?

# Scenario
Plugin the system to the plant soil
Open the dashboard 
Monitor the metrics 
If it is not moisturized enough, pump to start watering the plant
